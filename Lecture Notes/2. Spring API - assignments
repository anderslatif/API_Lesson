Part 1.

Create a person class.

1. Use url parameters to tell your person about yourself and have them respond with info about that subject.

2. Make path variables give you information about your person (they could refer to the variables in the person object).

3. Other fun stuff you want to try out.

Note: Since Spring is a RESTful API and we don't have an associated DB the person can be hardcoded.

Part 2 (After learning about Postman)

1. POST Text to your person.

2. Have the person "read" it and respond/interact with the text.
